# ðŸ“š**Final project: Pronunciation Curriculum Development**

## **Objective:** 
- Create a pronunciation-focused curriculum tailored to a specific group of English learners (beginners, intermediate, or advanced).

## **â™’Instructions:**

1. **Define your target group:** Choose a specific group of English learners for whom you will create the curriculum (e.g., beginners, intermediate, or advanced). Consider their age, language background, and learning needs when making your choice.

2. **Determine the curriculum duration:** Decide on the duration of your curriculum (e.g., a 7-week course, a semester-long program). Ensure that the chosen duration is appropriate for your target group and allows for measurable progress.

3. **Set learning objectives:** Clearly outline the pronunciation learning objectives for your target group. Consider both segmental (phonemes) and suprasegmental (stress, intonation, rhythm) aspects of pronunciation. Develop goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

4. **Create lesson a sample plan:** Develop one or two mini activies for one of the lessons, including the following components:

+ a. Lesson objectives
+ b. Warm-up activities: processes needed to be detailed.
+ c. Instructional materials and methods (e.g., book chapters, Praat exercises, AI tools, etc.)
+ d. Practice activities (pair work, group work, individual tasks)
+ e. Assessment and feedback methods (formative and summative)
+ f. Homework assignments
+ g. Extra resources for further practice or self-study (e.g., perception training using Praat MFC)

5. **Incorporate technology:** Integrate Praat and AI tools into your lesson plans, using them to supplement instruction, facilitate practice, and assess learners' pronunciation progress. Provide a rationale for your choice of tools and how they enhance the learning experience.

6. **Design assessments:** Develop a variety of assessment methods to evaluate learners' progress, including informal classroom assessments (e.g., observation, oral quizzes) and formal assessments (e.g., exams, presentations, or recordings analyzed with Praat or AI tools). Provide clear rubrics for evaluation.

7. **Create a teacher's guide:** Compile all lesson plans, materials, and assessment tools into a comprehensive teacher's guide, ensuring that it is user-friendly, well-organized, and visually appealing.

8. **Reflect on your curriculum (1 page in pdf format):** Write a reflection on your curriculum development process, discussing the challenges and successes you encountered, the rationale behind your choices, and any suggestions for improvement or adaptation in different teaching contexts. ðŸš©[Submit here](https://forms.gle/yfH3Wt3QSdHpuHPk7)

## â™’Submission Guidelines: 
**_ðŸš©All materials must be in digital format._**

+ Create your pronunciation curriculum, including the sample lesson plan, materials, and assessment tools, as .md file and a colab (.ipynb) format, in your github account. (Make a repository named "EPA23_MRK" (MRK - your initials at the end), folders if necessary)
+ Include your name, course information, and the title of your project.
+ Ensure that all sources are properly cited in a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA).
