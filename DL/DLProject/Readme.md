# Spring 2023 DL Final Project

The final project is to design examples of how digital tools can be used in English language learning or teaching methodology.

## How to submit (Due by 6/)

1. Create a Github account if you haven't already done so. Check your account [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17SX51lCqOdtvC7cAGoX5tP9fKwVdGY5sRzMg2pXh9uk/edit#gid=0)
2. Once you have created your account, create a new repository and name it according to your final project: **"DL23_Project"**
3. Create a new Github page (README.md) to describe your final project. You can use the built-in Github pages feature for this purpose. Make sure to include a detailed description of your project, including the goals, objectives, and expected outcomes.

4. Create a separate page (myproject.ipynb on Colab) for your Python coding. This page should contain the actual Python code that you used to develop your project. Make sure to include detailed instructions and descriptions in your code page, so that others can understand how to use your code and replicate your results.
5. Upload any relevant files or resources to your Github repository. This could include data sets, images, videos, or any other files that you used in your project.
6. Make sure to properly link your Python coding page to your project page so that it is easy for others to find and access your code.
7. Double-check to make sure that your Github repository and pages are set to public so that others can view your work.
8. Once you have completed these steps, share the link to your Github repository with your instructor so that they can review your work.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully submit your final project using Github. Good luck!

## Examples
### [Flashcards](https://github.com/MK316/Spring2023/blob/main/DL/DLProject/01_flashcards.ipynb)

: Vocabulary Quiz Generator: Have students create a Python program that generates customizable vocabulary quizzes. The program should take a list of words and their definitions as input and create a multiple-choice quiz for users to test their knowledge. The program can incorporate features like randomization of questions, adjustable difficulty levels, and performance tracking.

: Word frequency table, Words in context. Students create a Python program that generates customizable vocabulary quizzes. The program should take a list of words and their definitions as input and create a multiple-choice quiz for users to test their knowledge. The program can incorporate features like randomization of questions, adjustable difficulty levels, and performance tracking.

### [Text Analysis Tool](https://github.com/MK316/Spring2023/blob/main/DL/DLProject/3_WordFrequency.ipynb)

: Students create a Python program that performs basic text analysis on a given input, such as calculating word frequency, sentence length, readability scores, or common collocations. This tool can be helpful for teachers in selecting or creating appropriate materials for their students.

### [Pronunciation Practice Tool](https://github.com/MK316/Spring2023/blob/main/DL/DLProject/4_SpeechRecognition.ipynb)

: Students develop a Python application that helps users practice their pronunciation by comparing their spoken input to a reference audio file. The program should display a visual representation of the user's and the reference audio's sound waveforms, allowing users to see and understand the differences in their pronunciation. Additionally, the program can provide users with feedback and suggestions for improvement.
