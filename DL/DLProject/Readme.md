The final project is to design examples of how digital tools can be used in English language learning or teaching methodology.

## Examples
+ [Flashcards](https://github.com/MK316/Spring2023/blob/main/DL/DLProject/01_flashcards.ipynb)

: Vocabulary Quiz Generator: Have students create a Python program that generates customizable vocabulary quizzes. The program should take a list of words and their definitions as input and create a multiple-choice quiz for users to test their knowledge. The program can incorporate features like randomization of questions, adjustable difficulty levels, and performance tracking.

+ [Text Analysis Tool]()

: Students create a Python program that performs basic text analysis on a given input, such as calculating word frequency, sentence length, readability scores, or common collocations. This tool can be helpful for teachers in selecting or creating appropriate materials for their students.

+ [Pronunciation Practice Tool]()

: Students develop a Python application that helps users practice their pronunciation by comparing their spoken input to a reference audio file. The program should display a visual representation of the user's and the reference audio's sound waveforms, allowing users to see and understand the differences in their pronunciation. Additionally, the program can provide users with feedback and suggestions for improvement.
