# ðŸ’¦ Digital Literacy Week 11 Group activity

## Read and learn together (15 minutes)**

+ Your final project is to design a 50-minute English lesson, utilizing **various small English learning-related apps**. These small apps include activities for learning vocabulary, quizzes, grammar, or any activities for speaking, listening, reading, and writing. You can also include English culture or literature learning activities.


1. Here's a preview of the final project. Read it together. [Final project guide 01 link](https://github.com/MK316/Spring2023/tree/main/DL/DLProject)
2. You need to learn how to make a md file on github (just like this page you're looking at): This md type page will be used for a guide page of your project. [Refer to this markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to create an md file.

## Todo list (the rest of the time)

1. Create a file name "DL_Project_G0.md" on your github account (Group leader's account) > Individuals can copy the file later to your account. (Change "G0" => According to your group number)
2. You'll be discussing/collecting ideas about your final project, and summarize your ideas and processes in your DL_Project_G0.md file. This file shall be updated for 3 weeks. For today, collect brain storming, ideas, step by step processes you can think of a small activity in classroom (your future classroom).

### Notes:

+ For editing, you can use emoji [here](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908): copy and paste
