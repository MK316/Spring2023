# 💦 Digital Literacy Week 11 Group activity

## [1] Read and learn together (15 minutes)**

1. Here's a preview of the final project. Read it together. [Final project guide](https://github.com/MK316/Spring2023/tree/main/DL/DLProject)
2. You need to learn how to make a md file on github (just like this page you're looking at): This md type page will be used for a guide page of your project. [Refer to this markdown cheat key](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to create an md file. (Longer version is found in the Final project guide 01 link in the above)

## [2] Todo list (the remaining time)

1. As guided, create a repository "DL23_Project_G0", and create "README.md" file on the given repository (Group leader's account) > Individuals can copy the file later to your account. (Change "G0" => According to your group number)
2. You'll be discussing/collecting ideas about your final project, and summarize your ideas and processes in your README.md file. This file shall be updated for 3 weeks. For today, collect brain storming, ideas, step by step processes you can think of a small activity in classroom (your future classroom).
