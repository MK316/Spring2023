# üí¶ Digital Literacy Week 11 Group activity

Today, attendance checking will be done by the group leader. (let me know if anyone is late or absent via kakaotalk before 11:05AM)
## [1] Read and learn together (15 minutes)**

1. Here's a preview of the final project. Read it together. üí•[Final project guide](https://github.com/MK316/Spring2023/tree/main/DL/DLProject)
2. You need to learn how to make md files (e.g., README.md) on github (just like this page you're looking at): This md type page will be used for an online guide webpage of your project. üí•[Refer to this markdown cheat key](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to create an md file. (Longer version is found in the Final project guide 01 link in the above)

## [2] Todo list (the remaining time)

1. As guided, create a repository "DL23_Project_G0", and create "README.md" file on the given repository (Group leader's account) > Individuals can copy the file later to your account. (Change "G0" => According to your group number)
2. You'll be discussing/collecting ideas about your final project, and summarize your ideas step by step in your README.md file. This file should be used for your updates for 3 weeks. For today, collect ideas from your brain storming, step by step processes you can think of a small activity in classroom (your future classroom), or work load assignment among members. (Collaborative working is important, so do not simply divide workload.)

### Notes:

+ For editing, you can use emoji üòçüí•üå± [here](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908): You can copy and paste on your md file.
+ Your project should show interaction with students using digital tools, learner-centered lesson, colaborative, and technology assisted methods.
+ Use ChatGPT for English translation, grammar check, Python coding example, and so on. (Please proceed with this activity collaboratively, exploring together.)
+ This project file can be updated till the final submission.
